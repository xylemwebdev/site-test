  We’d love for you to join us in all our literary endeavors! Xylem has a close, hardworking staff of anywhere from 15-50 dedicated students interested in wide-ranging fields—from creative writing and publishing to finance and advertising to graphic design and communications. Since the mid-90s, Xylem has maintained a reputation for publishing some of the best creative work by students at the University of Michigan. Whether you’re interested in a leadership position as a member of our Executive Board, or if you would like to submit your own work for an opportunity to be a published writer or artist, or if you’d like a smaller role at one of the best student-run literary magazines on campus, Xylem is waiting for you.

  To be added to the Xylem staff email list for information about upcoming meetings and events, please email Clare Godfryd, the Editor-in-Chief, at goclare@umich.edu.
