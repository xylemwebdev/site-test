description: "At Xylem, we believe in the creative power of the unrestrained imagination.
  That’s why our only true requirement for submissions to the magazine is that your
  original creative work is shareable with the great wide world out there. \n\nOf
  course, send us poetry, short stories, creative nonfiction and photography. But
  how about screenplays, word art, prose-poetry, one-act plays, photographed sculpture,
  songs, puns, paintings, slam poetry, etchings, memoirs, fairy tales, cartoons, journal
  entries, interviews, limericks, anime, flash fiction, exquisite corpses, collages,
  or blackout poetry? We want Xylem to reflect the expansiveness of the artistic mind.\n\nGeneral
  Guidelines\n\nCreate something weird, artsy, poetic, wacky, beautiful, terrifying,
  funny, whimsical … you get the idea.\n\nSend it to us at xylemsubmit@gmail.com.\n\nDo
  it again. And again. And tell your friends to do it.\n\nThe Detailed Requirements\n\nWe
  have a blind submissions process to make everything fair and square. Please include
  your name and contact info in the body of your email or attached as a separate cover
  sheet, but leave your name off the creative work itself. This allows for all of
  our staff to consider your submissions anonymously.\n\nSubmit away! Multiple submissions
  of all kinds of art — visual, written, recorded — are welcome, but please limit
  yourself to 5 submissions.\n\nFor written work, please submit in one of the following
  formats: .docx / .doc  / .rtf\n\nFor artwork, please submit in one of the following
  formats: .jpg / .tiff"
